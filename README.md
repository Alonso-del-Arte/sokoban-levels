# sokoban-levels
Sokoban level collections in the *.sok format and the XML-based *.slc format.

I used Sokoban YASC and Windows Notepad to create the *.sok files. I created the *.slc files in Notepad and played them in Sokoban 3.0 by Ben Ruyl.

I've uploaded some of the levels to Game-Sokoban.com:

- Extremely Easy No. 5 http://www.game-sokoban.com/index.php?mode=ulevel&lid=2549
- Seemingly Hard No. 4 http://www.game-sokoban.com/index.php?mode=ulevel&lid=2550 and a few others of that set
- Frustratingly Difficult No. 1 http://www.game-sokoban.com/index.php?mode=ulevel&lid=2556 and a few others of that set
- Illustrative No. 7 http://www.game-sokoban.com/index.php?mode=ulevel&lid=2562 and a few others of that set
